          There are several websites today where people can post about 
          hobby electronics projects with single board computers (Arduino, Raspberry
          Pi, etc.), but they are just that - a post describing a project often 
          worked on by just one person. Maker-Collab aims to connect makers to work collaboratively 
          on their projects, which helps people build new skills, and share hardware 
          and software resources. Users post project ideass to their profile, and 
          other users can find projects in their area, and reach out to the project 
          idea creator to collaborate.<br/><br/>

          I built this web app to be responsive using Materialize, and kept styling
          simple and clean to allow users to find the information they're looking for
          quickly.
