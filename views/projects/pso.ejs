        The algorithm can be implemented in a very small amount of code, yet is able to search a complex design 
        space that cannot be minimized by simple differentiation. The name stems from the way that population 
        variables swarm around each other and influence each other’s movements, much like a flock of birds or a 
        school of fish. This method works well in numerically minimizing multivariate, nonlinear objective 
        functions with multiple constraints.

        During college, we applied the method to the problem of sizing an offshore Tension Leg Platform (TLP) 
        to maximize performance while minimizing cost, which I wrote in MATLAB. Below, I’ve rewritten a portion 
        of the code in a language called Processing to minimize a simple function in the form y = x^2. Obviously, 
        we can differentiate this function and it is unnecessary to perform numerical methods to minimize, but 
        this provides an easy example to graph output and watch the population variables ‘swarm’ toward the 
        global minimum (0,0) to verify that the code functions properly.

        Processing allows for the creation of some really cool visuals without a whole lot of code. 
        (Check out www.openprocessing.org to see some amazing examples.) Below is a screen capture of one part 
        of the code to get an idea of what the language looks like (I believe it's based on Java), and screenshots 
        of the visual output.
